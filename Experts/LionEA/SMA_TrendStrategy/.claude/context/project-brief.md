# Project Brief

## Project Overview

The SMA Trend Strategy project is an automated trading system for MetaTrader 5 that implements a sophisticated trend-following strategy based on Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossovers. This project aims to create a robust, reliable, and customizable Expert Advisor that can effectively identify and capitalize on market trends while maintaining strict risk management protocols.

## Project Purpose

### Problem Statement
Manual trading based on technical indicators requires constant monitoring, emotional discipline, and quick decision-making. Traders often miss opportunities due to fatigue, emotional bias, or inability to monitor markets 24/7. Additionally, consistent risk management is challenging to maintain manually.

### Solution
